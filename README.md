# AlbumJSON Generator
A simple program that generates album.json files for Warzone 2100's Music manager

# Instructions
The whole program is contained within the AJGen.c file. It uses only the standard C libraries and should be cross-platform compatible. The executable file must be located in the same folder as the album cover PNG file and the OGG/Vorbis music files. For more information on where to put the finished folder, see [the Warzone 2100 GitHub page.](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100)
The program operates entirely in CLI mode.
If the program encounters an album.json file already present in the folder, it aborts operation.
